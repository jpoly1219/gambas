# gambas

**gambas** is a data analysis library for Go, inspired by the famous Python library **pandas**. It provides an intuitive way to malipulate tabular data.

Although gambas is currently a personal project, but I hope this can be the beginning of something great.

### MVP Goals
---
- Provide basic features, from the pandas tutorial.
