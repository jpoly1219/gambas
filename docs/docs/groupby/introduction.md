# Introduction

`gambas` provides a way to group your data in different ways. Every `DataFrame` object can use the `GroupBy` method to group itself. Using the `GroupBy` method transforms the `DataFrame` object into a `GroupBy` object, which can be used to apply different operations.

For more information on how to use the `GroupBy` method, refer to the `GroupBy` section of [this page](docs/dataframe/reshaping.md).
