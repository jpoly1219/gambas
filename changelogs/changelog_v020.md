# Changelog for v0.2.0

## New features:
- Plotting is here! Use `Plot` to plot your DataFrame object.
  - Plotting uses gnuplot as a backend. To use the plotting feature, you need to install gnuplot first.
  - This feature is quite basic at the moment; more features and granular control will be added in later updates!
